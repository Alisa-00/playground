A collection of small projects, experiments, and learning exercises in C and assembly. This repository serves as a sandbox for testing ideas, exploring new concepts, and improving programming skills.

Each subdirectory contains focused work on a specific topic or project.

## Contents

- `C_employee-database` — Simple file-based employee tracking server/client.
- `C_misc` — Miscellaneous C tests, including basic networking/socket code.
- `x86_misc` — Basic x86 assembly practice scripts.

This repo is primarily for personal learning but kept clean and presentable for sharing.
